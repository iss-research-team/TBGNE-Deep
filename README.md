# TBGNE-Deep

# Prerequisites 
Python 3  
PyTorch  
# Getting Started 
Clone this repo. 
git clone https://github.com/iss-research-team/TBGNE-Deep/  
cd TBGNE-Deep  
# Dataset 
These datasets are sampled from the original datasets. 
T(echnology)B(usiness)G(eography) data, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, contains xxx nodes and xxx edges.  
# Training 
Training on the existing datasets 
You can use the sample data in TBGNE-Deep/data, or you can make your own dataset.
Representation of vectors in multilayer networks can be calculated by running TBGNE-Deep/src/run_pytorch.py
